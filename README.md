# CartThrob Sample Payment Gateways

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how a CartThrob Payment Gateway should, ideally, be laid out as a program.
They're pretty simple at the core, by design, though depending on your use case can be challenging in their own right. To help with this,
this repository contains multiple branches with different use cases and examples.

Be sure to check out the Wiki for details about the internals of a [CartThrob Payment Gateway](https://github.com/CartThrob/CartThrobPaymentGatewaySamples/wiki).
